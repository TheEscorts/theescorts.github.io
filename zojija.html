                <p>Zojija was youngest of her litter along with the biggest mischief maker growing up trying to prove to her siblings she was tough enough to hang around with them. She kept on being a pest till her elder siblings tried to force her to give up with joint locks which partially worked till she figured them out herself. Zojija was in her teens when she spoted her first starship that was there on her homeworld which perked her curiousity to the point she snuck inside of it while the captain was finalizing paperwork. What she didn't know was the captain had a decent size bounty on his head from a few jobs gone completely wrong which is common in the smuggling line of work. When he began the take off sequence Zojija tries to get off, but the door was sealed so she found a spot in the cargo hold and began to hide. After take off, but right before he was going to make a jump to hyperspace something hit his ship causing the Navi computer to begin claim that they are in the center of a gravity well. Zojija hear the sounds of something hit then attach itself to the freighter which nearly got her to leave her hiding place except her fear kept her rooted in place. While peeking through the spaces between cargo crates the captain ran to where the docking tube was connected took cover as what she would learn was a bounty hunter walk in from her ship. The fire fight didnt last long at all before the hunter had the captain shackled up with him complaining he is out of the slave trading game. The hunter started to believe him till she heard Zojija start to hiss at her from a distance which the captain tried to explain it was a misunderstanding only to be knocked out by the hunters fist. When she got close expecting to hear growls except she had flying cathar teen tacking her to the ground scratching and clawing at her helmet. She casualy fought off the girl expecting her to tire fast except the hits seems to improve on where they landed. After assessing that young Zojija was a good prospect she quickly rolled them over and pinned her down till she just layed there accepting defeat. She then offered Zojija the chance to train under her which she accepted without much thinking. After she turned the bounty in leaving the captain his cargo for when he got out to make the delievery. The next few months sculpted Zojija into fierce fighting feline good shot with a light blaster, her tools, and how to fight hand to hand quite effectively. Shortly after Zojija finished her teacher pissed off a sith of unknown rank and was killed off leaving her to fend for herself till she joined up with a team for the great hunt.</p>
